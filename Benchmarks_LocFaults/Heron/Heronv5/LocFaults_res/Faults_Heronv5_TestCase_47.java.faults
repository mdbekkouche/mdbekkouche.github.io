DOING LOCALIZATION...

Starting conversion of file: /home/bekkouche/eclipse-workspace/Benchmarks_LocFaults/Heron/Heronv5/Progs_with_spec/Heronv5_TestCase_47.java
Loops are unwound 10 times.
The size of the constructed CFG: 40

From the counterexample, LocFaults calculates MCS and IIS by exploring the graph in DFS from top to bottom and by deviating at most '3' conditional statements.
By deviating '0' condition(s), we obtain:
